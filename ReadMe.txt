	When I first started this game I wanted a game where you shipwrecked on an island that had a part both on land and in the water. While I was coding the game I realized that I could make it where you start in the middle, with water on one side and the island on the other, but then you need to explore the island to find the materials needed to get into the ocean where you ultimately win. I'd say I came pretty close to accomplishing what I wanted to accomplish when I was brainstorming for my game.
	There were lots of times when I got stuck but I got unstuck by utilizing either google, or my classmates, or just doing some creative thinking. Some examples of these could be when I was trying to figure out how to make a combining puzzle. I tried using someone in class but I couldn't seem to get how it worked so I went online. After hunting through the inform 7 website I found an example where you make a container and a table. In the container you have everything you want to make and then when you combine the things it removes them from the game and brings something from the container into the players inventory. I also used this concept for one of my puzzles where you need to inspect the sand and then it tells you about a shell. However there is no shell in the room and when you try to take it then it moves the object in from the container and you get the object. 
	In my game I incorporated a bunch of puzzles that all lead off of each other. The very first one is in the beginning you need to combine the flag, wood, and rum to make a torch. This torch lets you get into the forest which helps you progress. The Second part is when you are on the beach when you "x sand" it tells you about a shell which you can then take but you can't see the shell. A third puzzle would then be to take the shell and give it to the npc in exchange for a fishbowl which you use to breathe underwater to beat the game.
	A gameplay mechanic I was going to include was going to be "pirate talk" I was going to try and type everything out like a pirate but that was way too hard and it was hard to do consistently. I feel like I tried to add descriptions for almost everything so I feel like engaging the player is a gameplay mechanic.
	The beta testing phase was a little interesting. I had Kiana test my game and I also tried to get my mom to test it. Kiana helped play through my game and I got some good notes from the things she was trying to do and it helped to improve my final project. I asked my mom to beta test my game and she's never played any IF's before and she didn't like it at all. She had no idea what she was doing and she gave up almost immediately.
	I beta tested Kiana and Cody's games. I feel like my feedback helped Cody more than my feedback helped Kiana. In Cody's game I couldn't seem to win and I helped him to realize that he had mislabeled some of his directions. I couldn't really seem to give Kiana any advice.
	The thing that I am most proud of in my game is the fact that I made it. I actually designed and created my own game from basically nothing. However if I had to choose one part of the game that I'm most proud of it would have to be the shell part. I was having the hardest time trying to hide an object in a room but then I realized I could just use descriptive language and some instead rules and then voila it worked! The feeling you get when you finally overcome an obstacle is pretty amazing.
	If I could do one thing differently next time I think I would try to make the puzzles a little more challenging because I was trying really hard not to make my puzzles too hard. I think I might have actually made the game a little bit too easy for people to beat. However, for a first game, I'm pretty proud of it.
