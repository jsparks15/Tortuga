"Tortuga" by Jacob Sparks

[Combining Rule]
Understand "combine [something] with [something]" as combining it with. Combining it with is an action applying to two carried things. Understand the command "connect" as "combine".
Understand the command "attach" as something new. Understand "attach [something] to [something]" as combining it with.

The combining it with action has an object called the item built.
Setting action variables for combining something with something: 
	let X be a list of objects; 
	add the noun to X; 
	add the second noun to X; 
	sort X; 
	repeat through the Table of Outcome Objects: 
		let Y be the component list entry; 
		sort Y; 
		if X is Y: 
			now the item built is the result entry.

Check combining it with: 
    if the item built is nothing or the item built is not in limbo, 
        say "You can't combine [the noun] and [the second noun] into anything useful." instead.

Carry out combining it with: 
    move the item built to the holder of the noun; 
    remove the noun from play; 
    remove the second noun from play.

Report combining it with: 
    say "You now have [an item built]."

[Beginning the game]
When play begins: say "You wake up on the deck of your ship. Your head is throbbing, slowly you begin to remember what happened. The storm, the waves, the reef. You are lucky you managed to survive. Your crew on the other hand, was not so fortunate. Marooned on an unknown island, you should try to find a way back home."
   

[The Scallywag]
The Scallywag is a room. "Once a mighty ship, the best in the world, now lay in pieces on this mysterious beach. As you glance west you can see the deep blue sea, and to the east you can see a beach. The beach that you seem to be marooned on. Maybe you should look belowdecks for some supplies"

The sea is scenery in the Scallywag. "The brilliant blue ocean, it looks so calm and tranquil."
