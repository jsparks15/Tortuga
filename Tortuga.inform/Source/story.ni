[Combining Rule]
Understand "combine [something] with [something]" as combining it with. Combining it with is an action applying to two carried things. Understand the command "connect" as "combine".
Understand the command "attach" as something new. Understand "attach [something] to [something]" as combining it with.

	let X be a list of objects; 
	add the noun to X; 
	add the second noun to X; 
	sort X; 
	repeat through the Table of Outcome Objects: 
		let Y be the component list entry; 
		sort Y; 
		if X is Y: 
			now the item built is the result entry.

Check combining it with: 
    if the item built is nothing or the item built is not in limbo, 
        say "You can't combine [the noun] and [the second noun] into anything useful." instead.

Carry out combining it with: 
    move the item built to the holder of the noun; 
    remove the noun from play; 
    remove the second noun from play.

Report combining it with: 
    say "You now have [an item built]."
