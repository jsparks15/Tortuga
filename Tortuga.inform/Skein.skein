You wake up on the deck of your ship. Your head is throbbing, slowly you begin to remember what happened. The storm, the waves, the reef. You are lucky you managed to survive. Your crew on the other hand, was not so fortunate. Marooned on an unknown island, you should try to find a way back home.

The beach is actually more of a cove. It bears a slight remblence to Makapuu the waves break. The main features of this beach seem to be the sand, the water and the large rocks randomly dotting the sand. Further East, you can see the treeline of what seems to be a massive jungle.

Volcano
After a long hik to the top of the mountain you realize that it wasn&apos;t just any mountain. It&apos;s a live volcano. The crater is pretty sparce save for some lava and a crazy looking witch lady swimming through it.

You can see Calypso here.

You slide the piece of coral, widening the opening just enough for you to fit through. You swim through a small tunnel and pop up in a cave. The cave seems pretty large and is dimly lit by the eerie glow of large ghostly looking ship. On the ground next to the ship is a small little container.

A compass, seems to be oriented correctly. All you need is a ship and you should be able to get home in no time.

Could this be it? You&apos;ve heard rumors of this ship. It&apos;s said to be the fastest ship in the universe and captained by the most feared pirate of all. Nobody has ever seen this ship and lived, but now it&apos;s all yours.

Once a mighty ship, the best in the world, now lay in pieces on this mysterious beach. As you glance west you can see the deep blue sea, and to the east you can see a beach. The beach that you seem to be marooned on. Maybe you should look belowdecks for some supplies

You can see a Tattered Flag here.
