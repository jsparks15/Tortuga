You wake up on the deck of your ship. Your head is throbbing, slowly you begin to remember what happened. The storm, the waves, the reef. You are lucky you managed to survive. Your crew on the other hand, was not so fortunate. Marooned on an unknown island, you should try to find a way back home.

Tortuga
An Interactive Fiction by Jacob Sparks
Release 1 / Serial number 140307 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Scallywag
Once a mighty ship, the best in the world, now lay in pieces on this mysterious beach. As you glance west you can see the deep blue sea, and to the east you can see a beach. The beach that you seem to be marooned on. Maybe you should look belowdecks for some supplies

You can see a Tattered Flag here.

Once a mighty ship, the best in the world, now lay in pieces on this mysterious beach. As you glance west me can see the deep blue sea, and to me east I can see a beach. The beach that me seems to be marooned on. Maybe me should look belowdecks for some supplies
