You wake up on the deck of your ship. Your head is throbbing, slowly you begin to remember what happened. The storm, the waves, the reef. You are lucky you managed to survive. Your crew on the other hand, was not so fortunate. Marooned on an unknown island, you should try to find a way back home.

You slide the piece of coral, widening the opening just enough for you to fit through. You swim through a small tunnel and pop up in a cave. The cave seems pretty large and is dimly lit by the eerie glow of large ghostly looking ship. On the ground next to the ship is a small little container.

A compass, seems to be oriented correctly. All you need is a ship and you should be able to get home in no time.

Could this be it? You&apos;ve heard rumors of this ship. It&apos;s said to be the fastest ship in the universe and captained by the most feared pirate of all. Nobody has ever seen this ship and lived, but now it&apos;s all yours.

The beach is actually more of a cove. It bears a slight remblence to Makapuu the waves break. The main features of this beach seem to be the sand, the water and the large rocks randomly dotting the sand. Further East, you can see the treeline of what seems to be a massive jungle.

A jungle, packed with tons of trees. A path seems to be laid out through the middle of it. As you follow along the path it come to a split. Going north seems to lead toward a volcano and going south seems to lead into an even darker section of forest.

Ruins
As you begin walking through the pitch black darkness of the jungle you can faintly see a light all the way down at the end. As you emerge from the light you glance around at what appears to be some kind of ancient temple. There is some kind of drawing on one end of the room and a chest on the other side.

An old chest that looks extremly worn. It may have had a padlock at some time but now it&apos;s just sitting there.

Scallywag
Once a mighty ship, the best in the world, now lay in pieces on this mysterious beach. As you glance west you can see the deep blue sea, and to the east you can see a beach. The beach that you seem to be marooned on. Maybe you should look belowdecks for some supplies

Jungle
A jungle, packed with tons of trees. A path seems to be laid out through the middle of it. As you follow along the path it come to a split. Going north seems to lead toward a volcano and going south seems to lead into an even darker section of forest.

You can see a vines here.

Ruins
As you begin walking through the pitch black darkness of the jungle you can faintly see a light all the way down at the end. As you emerge from the light you glance around at what appears to be some kind of ancient temple. There is some kind of drawing on one end of the room and a chest on the other side.

You can see a chest (closed) here.

Scallywag
Once a mighty ship, the best in the world, now lay in pieces on this mysterious beach. As you glance west me can see the deep blue sea, and to me east I can see a beach. The beach that me seems to be marooned on. Maybe me should look belowdecks for some supplies

You can see a Tattered Flag here.
